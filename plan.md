Below is a detailed implementation plan outlining all the dependent files, changes, and integration points for the AI-powered Farmer & Retailer Web Platform.

---

## 1. Overall Architecture

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React/TypeScript) using Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive UI with multilingual support.  
- **Backend APIs:** Next.js API routes (under src/app/api/) for authentication, AI crop prediction, weather data, threshing marketplace, and admin functions.  
- **Database:** Use PostgreSQL for structured data (users, transactions, listings) and MongoDB for flexible crop data.  
- **Real-Time Notifications:** Implemented via Socket.IO (a separate server file under src/server/socket.ts) with a socket.io-client integration on the frontend.  
- **Third-Party Integrations (Free Alternatives):**  
  - Weather data from OpenWeatherMap free tier.  
  - Email-based OTP verification (in lieu of SMS/Twilio).  
  - AI crop suggestion powered either by a rule-based algorithm or a free LLM integration (e.g. via OpenRouter free model).

---

## 2. Environment & Configuration

1. **.env File:**  
   - Add environment variables:  
     - `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`  
     - `DATABASE_URL` (PostgreSQL connection string)  
     - (Optional) `MONGODB_URI` for MongoDB  
     - `OTP_SECRET` (a secret to sign/verify generated OTP tokens)  
   - Ensure these are added to `.gitignore`.

2. **next.config.ts:**  
   - Confirm API route support and adjust any needed rewrites for the multilingual structure if using next-i18next.

## 3. Backend API Routes

### A. Authentication APIs

- **OTP Generation:**  
  - **File:** `src/app/api/auth/otp/route.ts`  
  - **Steps:**  
    - Set up a POST handler that receives a contact/email number.  
    - Generate a one-time passcode (with OTP_SECRET for signing).  
    - Send the OTP via email (using a simple SMTP integration) and return a success response.  
    - Include error handling (400 for invalid input, 500 for internal errors).

- **OTP Verification:**  
  - **File:** `src/app/api/auth/verify/route.ts`  
  - **Steps:**  
    - Create a POST endpoint that verifies the submitted OTP against the signed token.  
    - Return a JWT token or session cookie after successful verification.

- **Signup:**  
  - **File:** `src/app/api/auth/signup/route.ts`  
  - **Steps:**  
    - Accept POST data containing role (Farmer or Retailer), contact number, OTP, and extra details.  
    - Validate fields:  
      - For Farmers: Name, agriculture land location (can be text/coordinates), soil type (dropdown options: clay, loam, sandy, etc.).  
      - For Retailers: Name, shop/company name, and location.  
    - Save user data to the PostgreSQL database and return response.  
    - Implement proper error handling (duplicate accounts, invalid OTP, etc.).

- **Login:**  
  - **File:** `src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts`  
  - **Steps:**  
    - Accept a POST request with contact number (and/or password fallback).  
    - Validate credentials against stored user data and issue a JWT token.

### B. AI Crop Prediction API

- **File:** `src/app/api/ai/crop-prediction/route.ts`  
- **Steps:**  
  - Create a POST endpoint receiving JSON body with `soilType`, `landLocation`, and optionally nearby farmers’ crop history.  
  - Use either a rule-based algorithm (with hard-coded logic) or call a free LLM API (via OpenRouter free tier) to return at least five crop suggestions.  
  - Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces, input validation, and a try-catch block to return HTTP 400/500 error codes on failure.

### C. Weather API

- **File:** `src/app/api/weather/current/route.ts`  
- **Steps:**  
  - Accept GET requests with query parameters (e.g., latitude & longitude).  
  - Use the `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` to fetch current weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.  
  - Validate external API responses and gracefully return errors if the API call fails.

    - Save listing to the database and emit a notification event via Socket.IO.

- **Search Listings:**  
  - **File:** `src/app/api/threshing/search/route.ts`  
  - **Steps:**  
    - GET endpoint allowing retailers to search listed threshing products by crop type or location.  
    - Return paginated results with error handling for no matches.

- **Cart & Transaction Requests:**  
  - **File:** `src/app/api/threshing/cart/route.ts`  
  - **Steps:**  
    - POST endpoint for retailers to add listings to their cart and request purchases.  
    - PUT/DELETE endpoints to manage cart state (pending, confirmed, completed).  
    - Notify both sides (retailer and farmer) via WebSocket when the status updates.

### E. Admin Panel APIs

- **User Management:**  
  - **File:** `src/app/api/admin/accounts/route.ts`

## 4. Real-Time Notifications (Socket.IO)

- **Server-Side WebSocket:**  
  - **File:** `src/server/socket.ts`  
  - **Steps:**  
    - Set up a Socket.IO server instance (this may run as a separate process from the Next.js server).  
    - Define events for: OTP notifications, crop suggestions available, threshing listing created, retailer interest, and transaction confirmations.  
    - Include error and reconnection handling.

- **Frontend Integration:**

## 6. Database Integration

- **Database Connection:**  
  - **File:** `src/lib/db.ts`  
  - **Steps:**  
    - Initialize connections to PostgreSQL (and MongoDB if needed for flexible crop data).

    - Implement proper error handling on connection and query failures.

---

## 7. Testing, Error Handling & Documentation

- **API Testing:**  
  - Use curl commands (as described) to test endpoints (crop prediction, weather data, listing creation, cart requests).  
  - Verify status codes and response times, and log any errors.

- **Error Handling:**  
  - In each API route, use try-catch blocks and return appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 401, 500).  
  - On the client, catch exceptions and display user-friendly error messages using available alert components.

- **Documentation:**  
  - Update `README.md` with setup instructions, environment variable details, API routes summaries, and testing protocols.  
  - Provide clear instructions on running the Socket.IO server along with the Next.js server.
